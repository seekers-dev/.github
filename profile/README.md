## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
We are a group of people who met during the 2022 [LSGM Mathecamp](https://lsgm.uni-leipzig.de/tiki-index.php?page=Mathecamp).

Our goal is to improve, perfect and extend the game Seekers that is used to teach programming by writing AIs in Python. Take a look at the [Game Concept](https://github.com/seekers-dev/seekers-py/wiki/Game-Concept) if you want!
